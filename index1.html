                                with a strong passion for web development.My passion is to design digital user experiences through the bold interface and meaningful interactions. During my academic journey, I have honed my skills in key web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. 
                                I completed my BTech from Amal Jyothi College of Engineering, where I laid a solid foundation in computer science principles.In 2023, I had the opportunity to intern at LTIMindtree, 
                                where I gained hands-on experience in a professional environment. This internship allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, further sharpening my technical abilities 
                                and enhancing my problem-solving skills.</p>
